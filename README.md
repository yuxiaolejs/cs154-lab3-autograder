# CS 154 Lab03 autograder v0.0.5
Yes, it is an autograder for CS154, lab3

## Known problem:
- Not testing zero register being written to

Requirement:
- Python
- pyrtl

## Notice:
- In order to test your code properly, this script assumes that your `addi` and `sw` are working properly. If you are not sure, please test them first.
- Please check version number of this script (will be displayed when running). If does not match this document, please update it!
- This server might not be available all the time. (It's not even a server, it's my desktop plus a FRP NAT proxy...) If the script complains about connection error, please try again later, and maybe consider using the javascript version `lab03_autograder.js` instead (but that script requires spim and nodejs in addition, so just run it on csil to avoid problems). Or if you want to help me and the class, please consider hosting a server for this script, and everything required for that is in the `server` directory (yes, again it's nodejs, see server deployment instruction below).
- If you found any bugs, please feel free to use the issue tracker on github to report it or just post it on piazza under [this post](https://piazza.com/class/lr49arnlyiq1kg/post/45) as a follow up.
- If you want to help improve this script, please feel free to fork this repo and make a pull request, things happening on the server side is under the `server` directory.

## Ways to install:
1. Download `test.py` from this repo to the same directory as your lab3_cpu.py
2. Copy from csil: `/cs/student/tianleyu/public/test.py`
   1. You can run `cp /cs/student/tianleyu/public/test.py .` in your lab3 directory to get it

## How to use:
- Copy `test.py` from this repo to the same directory as your lab3_cpu.py
- Confirm or change the test cases in `test.py`, `myTestCases`. Format is `"test": numberOfTestCases` Currently supports:
  - `addi`
  - `add`
  - `and`
  - `ori`
  - `lui`
  - `slt`
  - `lw`
  - `beq`
- Run `python3 test.py`

## Update:
- 01/27/2024: Use server to compile test cases. No `spim` or `nodejs` required.
- 01/30/2024: Add negative numbers to test cases
- 01/30/2024: Add register file tests

## TODO:
- [X] Add BEQ
- [X] Add LW

## Special thanks to:
- @r0ckwav3 - suggested to remove requests package to avoid missing dependency
- @r0ckwav3 - suggested to use register file to test

## Server deployment instruction:
**Note:** you don't need to read this part if you just want to use the script.

This following instructions are only test for ubuntu 22.04, but should work on any **linux** distro.
1. Install nodejs (with npm), I'm using v21, but any version should work.
2. Install `spim` - This is a tricky part, the usual spim installed by `apt` is not working, you need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Or, if you are using ubuntu/debian, you can just copy the `spim` binary from csil to your server.
3. Install Python3 (I think your server should come with it)
4. Install pyrtl (with pip) - run `pip3 install pyrtl`
5. Clone this repo
6. `cd server`
7. Install dependencies - run `npm install`
8. Run the server - run `node app.js` (please note that this will run the server in the foreground, it will stop when you close the terminal)
9. (Optional) Install pm2 - run `npm install pm2 -g` (pm2 is a process manager for nodejs, will allow you to run the server in the background)
10. (Optional) Run it as a service - run `pm2 start app.js --name lab03_autograder`
11. (Optional) Install `frp` - This is a NAT proxy, you can find it [here](https://github.com/fatedier/frp). This is only required if you want to expose your server to the internet and you don't have a public IP address.
12. (Optional) Configure `frp` - This is a little bit tricky, you need to configure it to forward port 13002 to your server's http port. Please refer to the `frp` documentation for more details
13. (Optional) Regularly update the server - run `git pull` in the `server` directory, then restart the server (if you are using pm2, run `pm2 restart lab03_autograder`)

It was long, but it's not that hard, right? Congratulations, you are contributing to the class now!
